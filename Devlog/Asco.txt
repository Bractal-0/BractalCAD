Boolean operation intersect

1	Geometry visibility and purpose (invisible mesh for volume)
2	Mapping 2D shape input to face-local space
3	Extrusion in 3D along a vector (normal of face)
4	Boolean intersection using CSG operations

Areas to Reflect or Refactor
A. Renderer Scope Issue

You're using renderer.domElement.height inside a module that seems to exist before renderer is defined.

Fix Conceptually:
Pass renderer and camera to grid-related modules at init, or store them in a central config.



adaptive spacing based on camera distance or grid fading for CAD-like UX



B. Coupling Between Modules

You're mixing app logic (scene, camera, controls, raycast) and visuals (cube, grids) into the same files.

Refactor Conceptually:
Use a CubeBuilder class that returns a ready-to-use group + uniform update functions.
C. Duplicated Shader Usage

Your gridMaterial is applied to plane.material and used separately for points.

Organize Conceptually:
Split into two shaders:

    gridPlaneMaterial – fragment grid

    pointGridMaterial – procedural point field

D. Label Visibility Control

Your axis labels are always visible, which could clutter when zoomed in or seen edge-on.

Add Logic:
Fade or hide based on camera angle or distance using onBeforeRender or in animate().
✅ Questions to Challenge Yourself

    How would you layer the grid above geometry without Z-fighting?

        (Hint: polygonOffset, render order, depthWrite)

    Can you make the grid spacing logarithmic?

        (Hint: implement in getRoundedSpacing() using log steps like 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50)

    What’s the cost trade-off between Points, Lines, and fragment shader rendering?

        (Hint: Think vertex count, draw calls, and fragment overdraw)
